# CHANGELOG

## 2.4.1 (29 October 2020)

* Use `__send__` instead of `send` internally.

## 2.4.0 (15 July 2020)

* `Zeitwerk::Loader#push_dir` supports an optional `namespace` keyword argument. Pass a class or module object if you want the given root directory to be associated with it instead of `Object`. Said class or module object cannot be reloadable.

* The default inflector is even more performant.

## 2.3.1 (29 June 2020)

* Saves some unnecessary allocations made internally by MRI. See [#125](https://github.com/fxn/zeitwerk/pull/125), by [@casperisfine](https://github.com/casperisfine).

* Documentation improvements.

* Internal code base maintenance.

## 2.3.0 (3 March 2020)

* Adds support for collapsing directories.

    For example, if `booking/actions/create.rb` is meant to define `Booking::Create` because the subdirectory `actions` is there only for organizational purposes, you can tell Zeitwerk with `collapse`:

    ```ruby
    loader.collapse("booking/actions")
    ```

    The method also accepts glob patterns to support standardized project structures:

    ```ruby
    loader.collapse("*/actions")
    ```

    Please check the documentation for more details.

* Eager loading is idempotent, but now you can eager load again after reloading.

## 2.2.2 (29 November 2019)

* `Zeitwerk::NameError#name` has the name of the missing constant now.

## 2.2.1 (1 November 2019)

* Zeitwerk raised `NameError` when a managed file did not define its expected constant. Now, it raises `Zeitwerk::NameError` instead, so it is possible for client code to distinguish that mismatch from a regular `NameError`.

    Regarding backwards compatibility, `Zeitwerk::NameError` is a subclass of `NameError`.

## 2.2.0 (9 October 2019)

* The default inflectors have API to override how to camelize selected basenames:

    ```ruby
    loader.inflector.inflect "mysql_adapter" => "MySQLAdapter"
    ```

    This addresses a common pattern, which is to use the basic inflectors with a few straightforward exceptions typically configured in a hash table or `case` expression. You no longer have to define a custom inflector if that is all you need.

* Documentation improvements.

## 2.1.10 (6 September 2019)

* Raises `Zeitwerk::NameError` with a better error message when a managed file or directory has a name that yields an invalid constant name when inflected. `Zeitwerk::NameError` is a subclass of `NameError`.

## 2.1.9 (16 July 2019)

* Preloading is soft-deprecated. The use case it was thought for is no longer. Please, if you have a legit use case for it, drop me a line.

* Root directory conflict detection among loaders takes ignored directories into account.

* Supports classes and modules with overridden `name` methods.

* Documentation improvements.

## 2.1.8 (29 June 2019)

* Fixes eager loading nested root directories. The new approach in 2.1.7 introduced a regression.

## 2.1.7 (29 June 2019)

* Prevent the inflector from deleting parts un multiword constants whose capitalization is the same. For example, `point_2d` should be inflected as `Point2d`, rather than `Point`. While the inflector is frozen, this seems to be just wrong, and the refinement should be backwards compatible, since those constants were not usable.

* Make eager loading consistent with auto loading with regard to detecting namespaces that do not define the matching constant.

* Documentation improvements.

## 2.1.6 (30 April 2019)

* Fixed: If an eager load exclusion contained an autoload for a namespace also
  present in other branches that had to be eager loaded, they could be skipped.

* `loader.log!` is a convenient shortcut to get traces to `$stdout`.

* Allocates less strings.

## 2.1.5 (24 April 2019)

* Failed autoloads raise `NameError` as always, but with a more user-friendly
  message instead of the original generic one from Ruby.

* Eager loading uses `const_get` now rather than `require`. A file that does not
  define the expected constant could be eager loaded, but not autoloaded, which would be inconsistent. Thanks to @casperisfine for reporting this one and help testing the alternative.

## 2.1.4 (23 April 2019)

* Supports deletion of root directories in disk after they've been configured.

  `push_dir` requires root directories to exist to prevent misconfigurations,
  but after that Zeitwerk no longer assumes they exist. This might be convenient
  if you removed one in a web application while a server was running.

## 2.1.3 (22 April 2019)

* Documentation improvements.
* Internal work.

## 2.1.2 (11 April 2019)

* Calling `reload` with reloading disabled raises `Zeitwerk::ReloadingDisabledError`.

## 2.1.1 (10 April 2019)

* Internal performance work.

## 2.1.0 (9 April 2019)

* `loaded_cpaths` is gone, you can ask if a constant path is going to be unloaded instead with `loader.to_unload?(cpath)`. Thanks to this refinement, Zeitwerk is able to consume even less memory. (Change included in a minor upgrade because the introspection API is not documented, and it still isn't, needs some time to settle down).

## 2.0.0 (7 April 2019)

* Reloading is disabled by default. In order to be able to reload you need to opt-in by calling `loader.enable_reloading` before setup. The motivation for this breaking change is twofold. On one hand, this is a design decision at the interface/usage level that reflects that the majority of use cases for Zeitwerk do not need reloading. On the other hand, if reloading is not enabled, Zeitwerk is able to use less memory. Notably, this is more optimal for large web applications in production.

## 1.4.3 (26 March 2019)

* Faster reload. If you're using `bootsnap`, requires at least version 1.4.2.

## 1.4.2 (23 March 2019)

* Includes an optimization.

## 1.4.1 (23 March 2019)

* Fixes concurrent autovivifications.

## 1.4.0 (19 March 2019)

* Trace point optimization for singleton classes by @casperisfine. See the use case, explanation, and patch in [#24](https://github.com/fxn/zeitwerk/pull/24).

* `Zeitwerk::Loader#do_not_eager_load` provides a way to have autoloadable files and directories that should be skipped when eager loading.

## 1.3.4 (14 March 2019)

* Files shadowed by previous occurrences defining the same constant path were being correctly skipped when autoloading, but not when eager loading. This has been fixed. This mimicks what happens when there are two files in `$LOAD_PATH` with the same relative name, only the first one is loaded by `require`.

## 1.3.3 (12 March 2019)

* Bug fix by @casperisfine: If the superclass or one of the ancestors of an explicit namespace `N` has an autoload set for constant `C`, and `n/c.rb` exists, the autoload for `N::C` proper could be missed.

## 1.3.2 (6 March 2019)

* Improved documentation.

* Zeitwerk creates at most one trace point per process, instead of one per loader. This is more performant when there are multiple gems managed by Zeitwerk.

## 1.3.1 (23 February 2019)

* After module vivification, the tracer could trigger one unnecessary autoload walk.

## 1.3.0 (21 February 2019)

* In addition to callables, loggers can now also be any object that responds to `debug`, which accepts one string argument.

## 1.2.0 (14 February 2019)

* Use `pretty_print` in the exception message for conflicting directories.

## 1.2.0.beta (14 February 2019)

* Two different loaders cannot be managing the same files. Now, `Zeitwerk::Loader#push_dir` raises `Zeitwerk::ConflictingDirectory` if it detects a conflict.

## 1.1.0 (14 February 2019)

* New class attribute `Zeitwerk::Loader.default_logger`, inherited by newly instantiated loaders. Default is `nil`.
* Traces include the loader tag in the prefix to easily distinguish them.
* Loaders now have a tag.

## 1.0.0 (12 February 2019)

* Documentation improvements.

## 1.0.0.beta3 (4 February 2019)

* Documentation improvements.
* `Zeitwerk::Loader#ignore` accepts glob patterns.
* New read-only introspection method `Zeitwerk::Loader.all_dirs`.
* New read-only introspection method `Zeitwerk::Loader#dirs`.
* New introspection predicate `Zeitwerk::Loader#loaded?(cpath)`.

## 1.0.0.beta2 (22 January 2019)

* `do_not_eager_load` has been removed, please use `ignore` to opt-out.
* Documentation improvements.
* Pronunciation section in the README, linking to sample audio file.
* All logged messages have a "Zeitwerk:" prefix for easy grepping.
* On reload, the logger also traces constants and autoloads removed.

## 1.0.0.beta (18 January 2019)

* Initial beta release.
